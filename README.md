# Python_tools
Some tools written in python I used in my graduate research

Brief description of each tool:

Hex_fitting: script to fit assigned hexamer transitions to a various rigid-rotor models

MG_fitting: script to fit measured second harmonic scattering intensities to a Langmuir isotherm; also functionality for
fitting competitive adsorption to a displacment Langmuir model

PLOT shell_use: old plotting script used to quickly plot spectra obtained from VRT experiment

SHG_scattering_plotall: Method to process batches of files outputted from SHS experiment with CCD detection.  Some data 
processing occurs inside the script including removing cosmic ray impacts and fitting to a Gaussian for siganl quantification
